# SampleWebApp
This project is meant to be used to test an applicant's skill set.

Instructions:
- Clone the repo from Github
- Create your own branch
- Do your best to make the two pages (Index.cshtml & About.cshtml) look as close as you can to the mock up (Adobe XD link)
- Use the Adobe XD mockup located here: https://xd.adobe.com/view/ecd35bb6-cb20-434f-be03-5f424e48c8d1-b980/screen/112e2a35-267d-4c9b-90ea-4545069c3ab5/
- The XD file contains all of the assets along with CSS specifics such as colors, fonts, sizes, etc. needed to create the pages
- The Nunito font used in the mockup can be downloaded or referenced. It is free and can be found here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito

Extra Credit:
- Add a media query for widths less than or equal to 712px that will modify the Index page to look like it does on Page 3 of the XD doc
